## anyFish ##

anyFish is a novel software tool for creating computer-animated stimuli of small fish in animal behavior. The software is distinguished by ease of use, methodological rigor, and end-user involvement. The proposal represents a close collaboration between end-users working on animal behavior and evolution, and developers working on computer-animation and video-game technology. Please explore the links below for information on required software and tutorials created to guide your use of the program.
